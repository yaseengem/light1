Solved the mysql query problem from a spearte file. It is working now.. Just add await and async in source index and desntation fnction.
Next I need to build the API for post,  get with id, and delete course.
Next it will be for all the apis.

Good article to work with collections in mysql.
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/connector-nodejs/8.0/tutorial-Working_with_Collections.html
Moved to mysql local instance.. And then used  env variable for setting the ip address. And it is working.
12:57: Desgning the db scehma now so that i can plan the apis after that. Let medesign the APIs andthen DB.
Server side DBSchema is first cut done. I will wrk on the user side schema later.
Tried to use objects to store value and then json strinigy.. But it is not working.. Seems that is not a widely used way.

Fire store seems tooo comlicated to searching text.. It cannot even search the sb string.. WHich will be very imporntant.. So I may have to look for an alternate solition.. Say like mySQL.
But then the question comes.. If the cloud fucntion is also even wroth.. it is also supposed to use node and express.. I can use a Vm today and do the development in a much simpler way. May be thats where, talib headed.. 
So it would be like Python backend. Flutter fron end. 
Firebasee authentication.. I wnted to check ifthere is an alternateive to firebase auth also.. But then it will be too far like Passport.js or authlib, etc.. It may be too risky for authentication like critical service.. So let me stick iwth firebase for now for auth. It will hellp withflutter being front end also. it can integrate well with firebase.
Next step: look for DB alnternative.. firebase is nnot useful.









20 Dec 2022:
Created two functions in differnt files. 
Created local env variables, 
Local  simulation working.
Deploy to Firebase is working.
Both local and cloud deployment tested in browser.
